This page is created as a side project for the course "Databases", which I attended during the 8th semester of my undergraduate studies at the School of Applied Mathematics and Physical Sciences at the National Technical University of Athens. This page visualizes the basic operations of a B+ Tree, such as insertion,deletion and search, according to the algorithms used in the book "Database System Concepts, 7th Edition" by Avi Silberschatz, Henry F. Korth and S. Sudarshan.

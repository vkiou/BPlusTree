This page is created as a side project for the course "Databases", which I attended during the 8th semester of my undergraduate studies at the School of Applied Mathematics and Physical Sciences at the National Technical University of Athens. This page visualizes the basic operations of a B+ Tree, such as insertion,deletion and search, according to the algorithms used in the book "Database System Concepts, 7th Edition" by Avi Silberschatz, Henry F. Korth and S. Sudarshan.
The files in this repository are:
* MyB+TreeVisualization.html : The main page.
* events.js : A javascript file that creates dynamic changes in the page.
* working.js : A javascript file that implements the algortihms for the B+ Tree, according to the book.
* style.css : A css file to style the page.

The URL to visit the site is this: file:///D:/SEMFE/8th%20Semester/Databases/Bonus%20Project/MyB+TreeVisualization.html
